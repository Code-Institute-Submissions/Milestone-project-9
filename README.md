# 'THE WHO'- First Milestone Project
The aim of the 'User Centric' end of module project was to create a website for a band based in 1960's. The website should reflect coding skills gained in HTML and CSS.
This website is created as a fanpage for 'THE WHO' fans showcasing; photos,audio clips and videos of performances by 'The WHO' which are embedded into the website. The website provides an option for fans to hire 'The WHO' for events such as weddings and Christmas parties if they wish to and to increase its fanbase.

## User Experience
The website aims to educate fans on; how the band was formed and the various members of 'The WHO' band through text description placed on the hompage. The website has a navagation bar to direct fans who may wish to ; view photos of the band, listen to audio clips of the band, watch video performaces of the band and who may wish to hire 'THE WHO' band  for events such as weddings and Christmas parties through contacting them via the contact form.
